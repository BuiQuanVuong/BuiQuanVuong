# Hi, it's Peter.

My name is Quan Vuong Bui, you can call me by *Peter*.

I am an IT student at Queensland University of Technology (QUT), majoring in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence.

I am expected to finish my degree by the end of 2027. 
My current GPA is 6.857/7.0.

I am interested in Machine Learning and in computer systems. I discovered my interest while doing the final project for IFB102: Introduction to Computer Systems, which I have a server hosted on a Raspberry Pi that streams real-time images from the attached camera and do OCR on that live images. The Raspberry Pi has very limited hardware resources so I need to take tradeoffs between the accuracy of the OCR, the latency of the stream, and the quality of the images. I managed to get things work using multi-threading, FFmpeg codec, and a few techniques from YouTube videos.

# My tech stack: 
*I am willing to learn more if needed.*

Languages:
Python, C/C++, C#

Frameworks and Libraries:
Pandas, TensorFlow, FFmpeg

_These are either a part of my coursework, or a personal project._
